We improve upon existing work by using attention mechanism in the decoder. We show that proposed improvement gives benefits in training time while does not degrade the quality of generation. We discover that training time is an issue, as RNN are hardly parallelizible and SketchRNN is expensive to train. Improving convergence speed allows for more efficient training sessions, achieving the same validation scores with 40% time reduction.</p> <p>We also tried training on a more complex, yet shallow dataset of sketches from DoodlerGAN, but the results are inconclusive. More work is required here.</p> <p><strong>Code</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ivanpuhachov/SketchRNN-Pytorch-Attention" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">github repository</a></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/sketchrnn/owls.png" data-zoomable=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/sketchrnn/owls_noatt.png" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Visual comparison of generated samples: (a) models with attention, (b) baseline model (without attention).

They play an essential role in any design process: rough pen-and-paper sketches are easy to produce, yet they are expressive enough to convey the idea. Contrary to realistic images, sketches are inexact and abstract.</p> <p>Sketch-RNN paper <d-cite key="sketchrnn"></d-cite> introduced a seq2seq VAE model to generate simple sketches. Drawing is composed as a sequential decison making process. RNN model was trained on a large dataset of simple sketches <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Quick Draw</a>. Ideas introduced in Sketch-RNN were then used to generate novel fonts in <d-cite key="lopes2019learned"></d-cite>, reconstruct corrupted images via BERT-like architecture in <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> <d-cite key="lin2020sketchbert"></d-cite>, generate svg images in <d-cite key="carlier2020deepsvg"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Note that in SketchRNN the final drawing is constructed as a set of polygonal chains. To get an image we rasterize lines on a canvas. This is a particular case of a more general <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector graphics</code> format, when image is stored as a set of primitives with drawing parameters (color, line width, etc.).</p> <p>Many sketch generation works focused on raster image generation, representing images as array of pixels. See <a href="https://github.com/MarkMoHR/Awesome-Sketch-Synthesis" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this github collection</a> of Sketch Synthesis papers for a general overview. In the recent work <d-cite key="doodlergan"></d-cite> a richer human-crafted drawing dataset was collected, targeted specifically to generate better-looking sketches. However, proposed GAN model generates raster images. We use their vector dataset <a href="https://songweige.github.io/projects/creative_sketech_generation/gallery_birds.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Creative Birds”</a> in our experiments.</p> <h4 id="proposed-idea">Proposed idea</h4> <p>Motivated by advancements in Natural Language Processing using attention mechanism, we propose an improved SketchRNN model with attention. The goal of this project is to train an improved model and compare it with the baseline.</p> <h2 id="baseline-sketch-rnn">Baseline: Sketch-RNN</h2> <div class="l-page"> <img class="img-fluid " src="/assets/img/sketchrnn/sketchrnn_arch.png" data-zoomable=""> </div> <div class="caption"> Architecture of SketchRNN model (baseline). </div> <p>SketchRNN <d-cite key="sketchrnn"></d-cite> is a Sequence-to-sequence VAE.</p> <p>Encoder is an unsupervised bidirectional RNN<d-footnote>Original paper uses HyperLSTM, we use LSTM to save computations for both encoder and decoder.</d-footnote>, the only goal of which is to get the joint hidden state (for each directions). Hidden states are then concatenated together and projected to two vectors $\mu, \sigma \in \mathbb R^{128}$ and a random sample is drawn from the distribution $z \sim \mathcal N(\mu, \sigma)$.</p> <p>Having latent code $z \in \mathbb R^{128}$ we then perform decoding. Decoder is a uni-directional auto-regressive RNN, that takes as input previous state and latent code. The outputs are passed as a parameters to $M=20$ Gaussian mixture models ($\Pi, \mu_x, \mu_y, \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \rho_{xy}$ for each of $M$ GMMs, $\sum \Pi = 1$) and we extract new offset vector $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$ as a sample from GMMs distribution. Pen state vector is extracted as a softmaxed projection of the decoder output. During training, we know the ground truth sequence, and next step of decoder is provided with correct input. During evaluation, the output point embedding of the previous step is passed to the input of the next step.</p> <p>Loss is a weighted sum of two terms: one is reconstruction loss $L_{R}$ (how well we reconstructed the starting sample) and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss $L_{KL}$ (how close the distribution of $z$ is to $\mathcal N(0,1)$).</p> \[L = L_R + w_{KL} \cdot L_{KL}\] <p>In our experiments, $w_{KL}=0.5$. During training, we use annealing term to mitigate KL loss influence in the beginning of the training.</p> \[\eta_{step} = 1 - (1-\eta_{min}) R^{step}\] \[L_{training} = L_R + w_{KL} \cdot \eta_{step} \cdot \max (L_{KL}, 0.2)\] <p>Reconstruction loss has two terms: loss for the offset $L_s$ and pen state $L_p$</p> \[L_s = - \frac 1 {N_{max}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_s} \log (\sum_{j=1}^M \Pi_{j,i} \cdot \mathcal N(\Delta x, \Delta y | \mu_{x,j,i}, \mu_{y,j,i}, \sigma_{x,j,i}, \sigma_{y,j,i}, \rho_{xy,j,i}))\] \[L_{p} = - \frac 1 {N_{max}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{max}} \sum_{k=1}^3 p_{k,i} \log (q_{k,i})\] <p>And Kullback-Leibner divergence can be interpreted as the parameter difference with the normal distribution. Original paper proposes this loss term:</p> \[L_{KL} = - \frac{1}{2N_z} (1 + \hat \sigma - \mu^2 - \exp (\hat \sigma) )\] <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2> <p>The backbone of our model remains the same as in SketchRNN, although original paper used more complex HyperLSTM, while we use LSTM to save computations (otherwise it would be infeasible given the time constraints and resources available). We use the same reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibner divergence. However, due to numerical limitations we use smaller model (with 256 hidden states in encoder and 512 in decoder).</p> <h3 id="attention-in-decoder">Attention in decoder</h3> <p>We utilize dot-product attention from <d-cite key="vaswani2017attention"></d-cite> and adapt it slightly for auto-regressive settings.</p> <blockquote> <p>Now at each time step the decoder network receives latent code $z$, previous point embedding, and a context vector $\in \mathbb R^{64}$, that is computed on all the previous points embeddings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Note that as we are in auto-regressive model setup, our attention context must not see the future token. During training we achieve this by masking alignment scores with $-\infty$ (this is required such that the softmax contribution of masked tokens is exactly 0). During evaluation, attention context vector is computed on the go. This attention mechanism is somewhat similar to XL-Net autoregressive attention (they do a two-stream attention for permuted language modeling).</p> <p>Context vector is computed by using query, key and value projections of starting embeddings $\in \mathbb R^5$, and combining them into scaled dot-product attention:</p> \[\text{Attention} (Q,K,V) = \text{softmax} (\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{n}}) V\] <p>We experimented with positional encoding, but found that it adds no effect neither to quality nor to the speed of convergence. We argue that in these low-dimensional input representations positional encodings do not convey any useful information.</p> <blockquote> <p>Although attention requires additional computations, during training it is highly parallelizible, as we already new all the inputs to decoder RNN, and proper masking ensure that future data does not leak into current step. In our setting, computing attention added 5 seconds to the epoch computation time (37 compared to 32 seconds, 15% increase).</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3> <ol> <li>“Quick, draw!” dataset used in <d-cite key="sketchrnn"></d-cite>, category <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owl</code>: 75,000 sketches, train / validation / test : 70,000 / 2500 / 2500 <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/sketchrnn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">google cloud link</a> </li> <li>“Creative Birds” from <d-cite key="doodlergan"></d-cite>: 10,000 sketches.

Each stroke point will be encoded as $(\Delta x, \Delta y, p_1, p_2, p_3)$, where $p_i$ is a pen status after the corresponding point (pen up, pen down, end of sketch), and the length is padded to 200 by repeating the token (0,0,0,0,1). Sequences longer than 200 are discarded.

After we cleaned all bugs in our code (the loss is particularly tricky to implement, and we took an open-source implementation after days of suffering), the training time comes to play. As we compute time-steps in RNN sequentially, they are slower to compute than typical convnets. Because of recurrence, “gradient explosion” problem exists, which result in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code> exceptions and training termination.

As it turned out, replicating the results from the existing paper \cite{sketchrnn} takes massive computational resources, so the proposed improvement is quite useful.</p> <p>Although model failed to generalize on the new complex dataset, it did not fail into “mode collapse” state. The results are still diverse and detailed, which suggests that more training is requires. The same can be said for a simpler “owl” class model – generated results are still not perfect, but with more computations we see no obstacles to replicate and even surpass the results from the original paper.</p> <h2 id="gallery">Gallery</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/sketchrnn/fat_reconstruction.png" data-zoomable=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/sketchrnn/more_owls.png" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/2021-sketchrnn-attention.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2024 Ivan 🇺🇦 Puhachov.
